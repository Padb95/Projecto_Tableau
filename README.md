My project is to compare global pollution with life expectancy.

So i started by taking a data set for each topic and cleaning them in Python to prepare them for Tableau. 
I tried combining them in tableau but realized that it would be more practical to combine them into just one data set and work like that in tableau.
Having said that, I started by testing various graphs and how to show the results of my research.
